 * This is a small hook that is used to determine if the app is currently being
 * used by a touch device or not. All this really does is switch between
 * mousemove and touchstart events to determine which mode you are in.  This
 * also tracks the `contextmenu` appearance since long touches can trigger the
 * context menu on mobile devices. When the context menu appears after a touch,
 * the mode will still be considered "touch" instead of swapping to mouse.
 *
 * @param touchTimeout This is the amount of time that can occur between a
 * touchstart and mousemove event but still be considered part of a "touch" user
 * mode. This should probably be kept at the default value, but if the touch
 * mode isn't updating as you would expect, you can try increasing or decreasing
 * this value until it does.
 * @return true if the app is in touch mode.
